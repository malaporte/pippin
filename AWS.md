# AWS CLI Auth in the Pippin Sandbox

How `aws` commands work inside the pippin sandbox without SSO browser
login or writable credential caches.

## The Problem

The AWS CLI supports many credential sources: static IAM keys, SSO
sessions, assumed roles, instance profiles, and more. Most modern setups
use AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO), which stores short-lived session
tokens in `~/.aws/sso/cache/` and resolved credentials in
`~/.aws/cli/cache/`. These cache directories must be **writable** — the
CLI updates them on every credential refresh.

This creates a dilemma inside the pippin sandbox:

- **Mount `~/.aws/` read-only**: The CLI can read `config` and discover
  profiles, but the SSO credential provider fails when it tries to write
  to the cache directories.
- **Mount `~/.aws/` read-write**: The container can modify the host's
  credential caches, SSO cache, and even `~/.aws/credentials`. This
  breaks sandbox isolation.
- **Don't mount anything**: The CLI has no profile configuration and no
  credentials at all.

Additionally, SSO authentication requires a browser login that cannot
happen inside a headless container.

## How We Solve It

At sandbox start time, pippin's `aws` tool recipe sidesteps the cache
problem entirely by resolving credentials to plain environment variables:

1. **Mount only `~/.aws/config`** (readonly) — This file contains
   profile definitions, default region, SSO session configuration, and
   role-chaining settings. It is never written to by the CLI.

2. **Do not mount `~/.aws/credentials` or cache directories** — Avoids
   the read-only-vs-writable conflict. The container has no access to
   `~/.aws/sso/cache/`, `~/.aws/cli/cache/`, or `~/.aws/credentials`.

3. **Resolve credentials via `envMultiResolver`** — At sandbox start,
   pippin runs `aws configure export-credentials --format env-no-export`
   on the host. This command resolves the active profile's credentials
   through the full provider chain (SSO, assume-role, static keys,
   credential process, etc.) and outputs them as `KEY=VALUE` lines:

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIA...
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=abc123...
   AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=FwoG...
   AWS_CREDENTIAL_EXPIRATION=2025-03-19T18:30:00Z
   ```

   Pippin parses all lines and injects them as environment variables in
   the container.

4. **Forward profile and region** — `AWS_PROFILE` and
   `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` are forwarded from the host environment if set,
   so the mounted `~/.aws/config` resolves to the correct profile
   inside the container.

When any AWS SDK or CLI runs inside the container, it finds
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in the environment and
uses them directly — no SSO provider, no cache files, no browser.

## Why `export-credentials` Instead of Mounting Cache Files

The `aws configure export-credentials` command is the linchpin of this
approach. Its advantages over mounting cache files:

- **Universal**: It resolves credentials regardless of the source. SSO,
  assume-role chains, credential-process scripts, static keys — all
  produce the same `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` /
  `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` output. The container doesn't need to understand
  the host's credential provider chain.

- **Read-only**: The command only *reads* the host's credential state.
  It doesn't write to any cache file, so there's no side-effect.

- **SDK-native**: Every AWS SDK (boto3, JS SDK, Go SDK, CLI) checks
  environment variables as the highest-priority credential source. No
  SDK-specific configuration is needed inside the container.

- **No writable mounts**: Since credentials arrive as env vars, the
  container doesn't need write access to any AWS directory.

## TLS

Pippin does not terminate TLS inside the sandbox. AWS CLI and SDK calls
use the container's normal CA bundle, so no extra proxy CA wiring is
required.

## Credential Expiry

The credentials injected at sandbox start are a point-in-time snapshot.
For SSO-based profiles, these are temporary STS credentials with a TTL
(typically 1–12 hours, depending on the IAM Identity Center session
duration configuration).

When the credentials expire, AWS commands inside the container fail with
`ExpiredTokenException`. The container has no way to refresh them — it
doesn't have access to the SSO cache or browser.

Recovery:

1. Re-authenticate on the host: `aws sso login`
2. Restart the sandbox — pippin re-runs `export-credentials` and injects
   fresh temporary credentials.

The `AWS_CREDENTIAL_EXPIRATION` variable is forwarded into the container,
so tools can detect approaching expiry programmatically.

- `src/cli/sandbox.ts` — CA bundle creation in the container bootstrap script (line 674), environment variable forwarding (line 620)

**AWS CLI:**
- `awscli/customizations/configure/exportcreds.py` — `aws configure export-credentials` implementation
- `botocore/credentials.py` — Credential provider chain (env vars are checked first)
- `botocore/session.py` — Profile resolution from `AWS_PROFILE` + config file
